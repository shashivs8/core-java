3.
Generalized Class:- a class which tells the main features but not the specific details.
           The class situated at the top of the inheritance hierarchy can be said as Generalclass.
Specialized Class: A class which is very particular and states the specific details. 
				The classes situated at the bottom of the inheritance hierarchy can be said as Specific Classes.
				
4. a)The class can be prevent inherited by other class by using final keyword.

   b) String , Math 
		This classes are in java.lang
	
	c) Delegation
		
5. Comparator and Comparable.

6. LinkedList : LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
				Search is slower in LinkedList as uses doubly Linked List internally 
				It store the elements as nodes
				Manipulation of data is Faster
   ArrayList:  ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.
				Search is faster in ArrayList as uses array internally which is index based
				It store the element as array manner
				Manipulation of data is Slower

				
7.  Iterator : - Iterator get elements in forword Direction only.
				 Iterator have only remove and hasNext().
				 Iterator Cannot modify and replace the elements
				 
	ListIterator : ListIterator get elements in both forword and backword direction only
				: ListIterator have hasnext(),previous(),next(),add()
				: ListIterator can modify and replace the elements
8. Covariant Method overriding means that when overriding a method in the child class, the return type may vary.
   Overriding the Covariant approach provides a way for you to return the subtype of the overridden methodâ€™s actual return class.		

9. memory leak is a situation when the garbage collector does not recognize the
 unused objects and they remain in the memory indefinitely that reduces the
 amount of memory allocated to the application   

 10. Dynamic polymorphism is a process or mechanism in which a call to an overridden method is 
 to resolve at runtime rather than compile-time. It is also known as runtime polymorphism or
 dynamic method dispatch. We can achieve dynamic polymorphism by using the method overriding.
 
 Static polymorphism is a type of polymorphism that collects the information to call a method during compile time while dynamic
 polymorphism is a type of polymorphism that collects information to call a method at run time. 
 Thus, this is the main difference between static and dynamic polymorphism.
 
 11. By Encapsulation , she can make properties by making Private, and she can set and get data by using Setter and Getter
